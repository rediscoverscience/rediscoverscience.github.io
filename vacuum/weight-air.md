# Experiment: Measuring the Density of Air

How do we know that air has weight? How much does air weigh? 

In his book *Dialogues Concerning Two New Sciences*, Galileo described an experiment that answered both these questions.

Galileo took a round bottomed flask which had an airtight stopcock. He used a syringe to forcibly push more air into the flask, and saw that the weight of the flask had increased. This showed that air had weight. But how much?

Since the syringe gave a measure of the volume of air contained in it, the volume of *extra* air forced into the flask could be determined. The increase in mass of the flask gave the weight of the extra air, and this weight divided by the volume of extra air gave the density of air.

## A modern re-creation of Galileo's experiment

### Materials needed

* A plastic cold drinks bottle
* A 1/4" plastic valve used in RO water purifying systems
* A 60 mL syringe
* A knife of a pair of scissors *(**Warning:** It will be used for melting and cutting through plastic; it should not be used for cooking or cutting food packets thereafter.)*
* A candle
* Fevi-kwik
* Araldite epoxy resin
* A 60 mL syringe
* A rubber tube from an IV-set
* A digital balance with a least count of 0.01 gram

### 1. Fixing the valve on the bottle

1. Heat the knife (or scissors) in a candle flame, and cut a <size> hole on the side of the bottle.
2. Insert the plastic RO valve into the hole and stick it with Fevi-kwik. Let it dry for 10 minutes.
3. Use araldite to seal all the gaps between the bottle and the valve and make it airtight. Again let it dry for 10 minutes.

The bottle with the valve is now ready to use

### 2. Measuring the weight of air

1. Close the lid of the bottle tightly. Open and then close the tap, to let out any compressed air inside.
2. Weigh the bottle on the digital balance. Note down this weight. ____________________ g
3. Pull the plunger of the syringe till 60 mL mark.
4. Connect the nozzle of the syringe to the tap.
5. Open the tap while holding the nozzle tightly against the tap.
6. Use the syringe to push the air into the bottle through the tap.
7. Close the tap and remove the syringe.
8. Repeat steps 3 to 8 to fill the air four more times into the bottle.
9. The volume of air you have pushed into the bottle = ____________ mL
10. Weigh the bottle on the digital balance. Note down this weight. ____________________ g
11. Difference between the weights measured in steps 2 and 10 = __________________ g
12. Density of air = __________ / __________ g/mL = ___________ kg/m3
