# Experiment: Measuring the Density of Air

How do we know that air has weight? How much does air weigh? 

In his book *Dialogues Concerning Two New Sciences*, Galileo described an experiment that answered both these questions.

Galileo took a round bottomed flask which had an airtight stopcock. He used a syringe to forcibly push more air into the flask, and saw that the weight of the flask had increased. This showed that air had weight. But how much?

Since the syringe gave a measure of the volume of air contained in it, the volume of *extra* air forced into the flask could be determined. The increase in mass of the flask gave the weight of the extra air, and this weight divided by the volume of extra air gave the density of air.
