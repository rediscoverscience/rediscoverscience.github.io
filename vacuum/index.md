# Does Vacuum Pull Things?

Ask anyone what happens when you drink juice through a straw, and chances are that you'll get responses like: "When you suck air out from the straw, something has to take is place". Or "There is a suction force created which pulls the juice up." If the person has learned high school science, you might get a response like: "When you suck air, it reduces the pressure in the straw, and the   higher atmospheric pressure outside pushes the juice up."

The last explanation is generally considered 'correct' today, but interestingly all these explanations reflect conceptions that scientists in the past have held at one point or another. The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle coined the famous principle of impossibility of vacuum- *"Natura vacuum abhorret"* - Nature Abhors Vacuum. This is essentially the same as saying when you take out air, something has to take its place, because nature abhors a vacuum. This was the dominant belief for centuries, until Galileo raised questions in the 16th century.

What implications does this have for science teaching? More often than not, when a concept is taught in science, the 'correct' explanation is given ready-made to the students. The history of science shows us the possibilities of engaging with alternate conceptions that students may have, by analyzing phenomena and encountering situations that cannot be explained by a pre-existing conception, forcing one to modify it. This process makes it more likely that a student understands a modern concept better by going through the actual development of the concept. Furthermore, this process is essentially what we call 'science'. 

This series of articles narrates the development of the concept of air pressure from Aristotle to Robert Boyle, including ways to tap into this story to design new approaches to teaching.
