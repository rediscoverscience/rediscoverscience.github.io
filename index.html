<div class="blurb">
	<h2>What the history of science can teach us</h2>
	<p>Science education in schools today has become almost solely about mastering received knowledge and concepts. At its best- applying concepts to solve certain types of problems, and at its worst- regurgitating sets of obscure facts.</p>
	<p>A radically different general science education is needed. One that focuses on how human beings have found out all that we know about the natural world. One that delves deep into how knowledge is constructed. One that brings the students in contact with some of the magic and mystery of the natural world that past scientists devotes their lives to making sense of.</p>
	<p>This website aims to be a window into the possibilities for science education that history of science offers. A portal to make the historical development of different scientific ideas accessible to school science teachers, and illustrate examples how history of science can be incorporated into teaching. Also documented are a variety of historical experiments which can be easily replicated with commonly available materials, which promise tremendous pedagogical value.</p>
