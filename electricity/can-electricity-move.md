# Can Electricity Move?

At the beginning of the 18th century, scientists ('natural philosophers' as they were called at the time) did not know much about electricity apart from the fact that several materials acquired the property of attracting small objects when rubbed. A significant new property was discovered in the 1720s by Stephen Grey, an Englishman.

Stephen Grey had a glass tube which he used for his electrical experiments. When the tube was not in use, Grey fitted a cork to each of its ends to keep the dust out. (pic)

One day, Grey was curious whether there was any difference in the tube's attracting power when it was used with the ends closed with cork. He did not notice any difference in the attracting power. However, he was surprised to see that when the tube was rubbed, a feather got attracted to the cork just as well as it would have to the tube itself. 

Why was he was surprised? He had rubbed only the tube, not the cork. The only explanation he could think of, was that the electric property was communicated to the cork from the tube, by contact.

## Recreating Grey's Experiment

### Materials needed

* PVC pipe - 1" diameter, 2' long
* a rubber stopper
* a few pieces of aluminium foil

Grey's experiment can be easily re-created using a PVC pipe instead of a glass tube. If you can find a glass tube that gets easily electrified by rubbing, go ahead and use that, but I have not been able to find one. Also, these days, rubber stoppers are more commonly used in labs, and work just as well for the purpose of this experiment. I used aluminium foil instead of feathers to check the attraction.

## How far can the electric property be communicated?
